    title: "CubeSat for Real-Time Weather Prediction",
    fullDescription: "The CubeSat for Real-Time Weather Prediction project is an innovative step toward improving the way we monitor and forecast weather conditions. Using a low-cost, lightweight satellite model (CubeSat) mounted on a drone, we aim to create a scalable, accessible platform for atmospheric data collection. This project involves the design, development, and deployment of a miniature satellite equipped with environmental sensors to gather critical meteorological data. The data collected (temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, etc.) is then transmitted in real-time to ground stations for processing. The long-term goal is to integrate this data into predictive models to enhance local weather forecasting accuracy and provide valuable insights for agricultural planning, disaster preparedness, and urban development. This project fosters interdisciplinary skills in aerospace engineering, data science, and telecommunications.",

    title: "Custom-Built Drone Development",
    fullDescription: "At SAOSC, we believe that true learning comes from building and applying technology with our own hands. Our Custom-Built Drone Development & Applications Project is a testament to this philosophy. Instead of relying on pre-assembled kits, we took the challenge of designing, assembling, and testing a drone ourselves. This project covers all aspects of drone engineering, from selecting appropriate motors, propellers, and flight controllers to designing and fabricating the frame using lightweight materials. Members gain experience in electronics, aerodynamics, programming (for flight control and autonomous missions), and remote sensing. Practical applications include aerial photography, package delivery simulations, environmental monitoring, and search and rescue scenarios. This hands-on experience provides a deep understanding of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems and their potential.",

    title: "Design and Development of an RC Fixed-Wing Aircraft",
    fullDescription: "The Design and Development of an RC Fixed-Wing Aircraft project was our entry point into the world of aeronautics and model aircraft engineering. With curiosity as our guide and a determination to learn, we set out to design and fly our very own RC plane. This project encompasses fundamental aerodynamic principles, material selection, structural design, and remote control systems integration. Students learn about airfoil design, thrust-to-weight ratio, stability, and control mechanisms. The practical build experience, from cutting and shaping foam or balsa wood to installing electronics and conducting flight tests, offers invaluable insights into the challenges and rewards of aerospace design. It serves as a strong foundation for more complex aerial vehicle projects.",

    title: "An AI/ML Framework for Smart Data Prediction",
    fullDescription: "The AI/ML Framework for Smart Data Prediction project aims to revolutionize how we analyze and interpret complex datasets within aerospace and other domains. We're developing a robust, open-source framework that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns, predict outcomes, and automate decision-making processes. This project involves working with large datasets, selecting and training various ML models (e.g., neural networks, regression models), and deploying them for real-time inference. Applications include predictive maintenance for aircraft, optimized flight path planning, anomaly detection in sensor data, and intelligent resource allocation. Members enhance their skills in Python programming, data science, machine learning, and cloud computing, preparing them for the rapidly evolving field of AI-driven aerospace innovation.",

    title: "ARDUINO BASED OBJECT AVOIDANCE CAR",
    fullDescription: "The Arduino-Based Object Avoidance Car project was one of our first steps into the world of electronics, robotics, and embedded systems. Our goal was not just to build a moving car, but to understand how sensors, microcontrollers, and actuators work together to create intelligent behavior. This project involved assembling a chassis, mounting ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection, integrating motor drivers, and programming an Arduino microcontroller to process sensor data and control the car's movement. Students learned about basic circuit design, C++ programming for Arduino, digital and analog inputs, and algorithm development for autonomous navigation. Itâ€™s an excellent introductory project that demystifies robotics and provides a tangible understanding of how code interacts with the physical world.",
